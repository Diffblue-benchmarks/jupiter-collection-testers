Jupiter Collection Testers
===

Jupiter Collection Testers allows you to exhaustively test your Java
collections with JUnit Jupiter, part of [JUnit 5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5).

This project is similar to [Guava](https://github.com/google/guava)'s
[collection](https://blog.codefx.org/techniques/testing/test-collection-implementations-with-guava/)
[testers](https://www.klittlepage.com/2014/01/08/testing-collections-with-guava-testlib-and-junit-4/)
for JUnit 4.

Getting started
---

This project is not production ready yet.

I aim to introduce continuous integration builds and to publish snapshots and releases to Maven
Central sooner rather than later. (I'd appreciate help with settings things up!)

I'll write instructions on how to use Jupiter Collection Testers in your tests after snapshots are
being pushed to Maven Central.
